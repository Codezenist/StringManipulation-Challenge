# String Manipulation Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **House of Code Phase 1 Challenge**, which focuses on string manipulation in C. The challenge includes three core problems:

1. **Problem 1**: Counting Runes (Implementing `My_strlen()`).
2. **Problem 2**: The Lost Scrolls of Algoria (Reversing a string).
3. **Problem 3**: The Whisper of the Ancients (Reversing words in a string).

## Files

- `problem1.c`: Solution for Problem 1 (Implementing `My_strlen()`).
- `problem2.c`: Solution for Problem 2 (Reversing a string).
- `problem3.c`: Solution for Problem 3 (Reversing words in a string).

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Codezenist/StringManipulation-Challenge.git
